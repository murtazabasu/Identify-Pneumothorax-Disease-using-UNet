Pneumothorax can be caused by a blunt chest injury, damage from underlying lung disease, or most horrifyingâ€”it may occur for no obvious reason at all. On some occasions, a collapsed lung can be a life-threatening event. Pneumothorax is usually diagnosed by a radiologist on a chest x-ray, and can sometimes be very difficult to confirm. An accurate AI algorithm to detect pneumothorax would be useful in a lot of clinical scenarios. AI could be used to triage chest radiographs for priority interpretation, or to provide a more confident diagnosis for non-radiologists.

In this repository a model is developed using UNet with the help of Convolution Neural Networks that takes a chest x-ray image as input and predicts whether the given image has a pneumothorax or not. The `SIIM_ACRDataset` class in `data.py` performs preprocessing and augmentation on the images and the masks from the dataset before feeding it to the model for training. The dataset is available at `https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/pneumothorax-chest-xray-images-and-masks`.

#### Criterion for using this repository:
- This project was tested on Python 3.7 using Conda Distribution
- Choose the `num_workers` for parallelizing the training and validation dataset using pytorch based on your system specification.
- If your cuda memory gets full, try resizing the images using `img_resize` argument and also try decreasing the batch size for training.

#### Requirements
Install the following packages:
- NVIDIA Apex for mixed precision training. If you have a single GPU then normal `loss.backward()` should suffice, therefore you can avoid this installation. 
```
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex
pip install -v --no-cache-dir --global-option="--cpp_ext" --global-option="--cuda_ext" ./apex
```
- Albumentation library for image augmentation
```
pip install albumentations
```
